# Cursor Rules for Launch Site Project

## Server Management
- Always shutdown any development servers (npm run dev, npm start, etc.) after completing changes
- Use `pkill -f "next dev"` or similar commands to ensure servers are properly terminated
- Do not leave background processes running after task completion

## Development Workflow
- When testing builds or running development servers, always clean up processes
- If a server is started for testing, explicitly stop it before considering the task complete
- Use `jobs` command to check for running background processes and terminate them

## Code Quality
- Ensure all linting errors are resolved before completing tasks
- Run builds to verify changes work correctly
- Clean up any temporary files or processes created during development

## Project Structure
- This is a Next.js project with custom theme management
- Uses TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- No MDX dependencies (removed)
- Custom theme context replaces next-themes
